This is my first time with Node.JS and Express.JS working on the basics and trying to understand the backend Javascript style. It has proven to be quite enlightening and moving from the frontend to the backend with Javascript has been a lot easier than I would have initially imagined.

### The Site
Originally I had considered building out a social media style site as it would allow working on every element, however I was not overly keen on the idea and the site is morphing to be more media focused. I am still in process of building it out and testing the modules out so I will see where this ends up.

### Javascript All The Way Down
This is also my first attempt at a complete Javascript application, I have learnt a great deal already and the use of Pug as a template engine has proven to be interesting, if not a bit tricky at times. Pug is something I feel will make for a great template engine although it does require some getting use to after regular HTML.
